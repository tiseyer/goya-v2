## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Mirror Admin Settings sidebar pattern for consistency across admin/user experiences
- `app/settings/` as root route for clean separation from profile pages
- Connections + Inbox as placeholders — full implementation now in v1.1
- [Phase 03]: Server component for Subscriptions page — data fetched at request time, no client JS needed
- [Phase 03-settings-pages]: Profile settings form migrated to app/settings/page.tsx; server action reused from app/profile/settings/actions.ts
- [Phase 04-database-foundation]: unique(requester_id, recipient_id) prevents duplicate connection requests at DB level
- [Phase 04-database-foundation]: type constrained to peer/mentorship/faculty matching role-aware UI in Phase 5
- [Phase 04-database-foundation]: status defaults to pending; insert by requester only, update by either party
- [Phase 04-database-foundation]: unique(requester_id, recipient_id) prevents duplicate connection requests at DB level
- [Phase 04-database-foundation]: type constrained to peer/mentorship/faculty — matches role-aware UI in Phase 5
- [Phase 04-database-foundation]: status defaults to pending; insert-only by requester, update by either party

### Pending Todos

- Run `npx supabase db push` after creating the connections migration (Phase 4)

### Blockers/Concerns

- ConnectButton.tsx and ConnectionsContext.tsx exist but use localStorage/mock data — Phase 4 replaces this
- `conversations`, `messages`, `notifications` tables exist in Supabase but NO `connections` table yet — Phase 4 creates it
- Settings > Connections and Settings > Inbox are placeholder pages — Phase 6 implements them
- Admin user detail view has tabs but no Connections tab yet — Phase 7 adds it
- Profile page has a "Connect with [User]" button in the right sidebar — Phase 5 makes it role-aware
